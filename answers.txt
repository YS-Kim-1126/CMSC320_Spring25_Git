Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to various fields, including sports.
For example, in soccer, wearable devices can be attached to players to collect real-time data such as heart rate,
distance covered, speed, and positioning. This data can then be analyzed to evaluate player performance,
optimize training routines, and develop effective strategies. By leveraging these insights,
coaches can make data-driven decisions to improve team tactics, enhance player fitness,
and gain a competitive edge during matches.
