Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer:Using Git in school project is highly beneficial because it provides version control, allowing you to
track changes and revert to previous versions if needed. It enables seamless collaboration, letting
multiple team members work on the project simultaneously and merge their changes efficiently. With branching, 
you can develop new features or experiment without disrupting the main codebase. 
Also Git acts as a backup by storing your code in a remote repository, protecting it from local issues. 
Finally, it supports code reviews through pull requests, helping your team improve code quality and catch errors early.
