Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Using Git in school project is highly beneficial because it provides version control, allowing you to
track changes and revert to previous versions if needed. It enables seamless collaboration, letting
multiple team members work on the project simultaneously and merge their changes efficiently. With branching, 
you can develop new features or experiment without disrupting the main codebase. 
Also Git acts as a backup by storing your code in a remote repository, protecting it from local issues. 
Finally, it supports code reviews through pull requests, helping your team improve code quality and catch errors early.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to various fields, including sports.
For example, in soccer, wearable devices can be attached to players to collect real-time data such as heart rate,
distance covered, speed, and positioning. This data can then be analyzed to evaluate player performance,
optimize training routines, and develop effective strategies. By leveraging these insights,
coaches can make data-driven decisions to improve team tactics, enhance player fitness,
and gain a competitive edge during matches.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging preserves the branch history and creates a merge commit, 
while rebasing rewrites history to create a linear sequence of commits.
Use merging when you want to maintain a clear record of branch divergence and merging.
Use rebasing when you want a cleaner, linear history, especially before sharing your changes with others.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: This semester, I'm excited to learn various programming tools for collecting and analyzing data in this
class. My goal is to apply these new techniques to a website I created during the break, 
which organizes soccer player statistics. I look forward to enhancing the site with more advanced and user-friendly
features, making it even more useful and insightful for soccer fans!
